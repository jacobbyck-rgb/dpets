# Diamond Pet Foods playbook

Live page: https://claude.ai/artifact/YRsSGGsJxgZNavYAWCbgQn (shared db: `orders`, `warehouses`, `rhythm`).

## When Jacob sends an update (email, Slack, screenshot, PDF)

Update the live board right away, without being asked, using ArtifactData on the URL above:

- Read the order first (`get orders/WN-#####`) and pin writes with `if_version`.
- Change every field the update touches: `stage` (+ `stageSince` = today when the stage moves),
  `masterPo` (on every order it covers), `group`, `apptDate`/`apptTime`/`conf`, `pallets`/`skus`/`qty`,
  `wh`, `payer`, quote counts (`qHandled`, `qReworked`, `qDisposed`), `closeout` ticks, `nextNote`.
- Append what happened, dated, to `notes`. Don't drop earlier notes.
- New WN# → create `orders/WN-#####` with the same fields the page uses (`wn`, `po`, depot fields from the PO, `wh`, `stage`, `stageSince`, `closeout: {}`, `created`).
- Then tell Jacob what changed per WN# and what's next, and draft any reply/email he needs to send.

## Slack (connector)

New Diamond orders get a Slack channel from Capri (e.g. `#13135-monrovia-md-rework-diamond-pet-foods-northeast`;
some start under the carrier's name, e.g. `...-pace-logistics-...`, and get renamed). They land in Jacob's
"Diamond Pet" sidebar section. Track only NEW orders as they come in (plus the orders already on the board);
don't backfill the old channels. When Jacob says "update WN-#####", read that channel yourself and update the board.

## After changing the page itself

`python3 tools/build.py <Diamond xlsx>` → test → commit/push → refresh `snapshot/` (ArtifactData list, out_dir) →
publish `diamond-playbook.html` to the URL above → send the download and include the live link.

Quotes, the warehouse and the customer live in the WarehouseNow web app (Quotes tab); the board mirrors them.
Payer defaults to Diamond direct; only change it if Thomas says the carrier pays. Carrier pays → the Load # in the app must be changed to the carrier.
App Load # = the Costco PO from the email subject (asked Genderson whether it should be the master PO instead). Track `payer` and `payerOk` on the board.

New emails in Front (ADW ticket etc.): Compose new, tag with the WN#, add to the Diamond Pet mailbox (diamondpet@warehousenow.com).

Keep Diamond paperwork (PDFs, BOLs, stickers, photos) out of git.
